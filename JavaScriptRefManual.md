# My JS manual = big heading
**Bold** to `JS` - backticks to show excerpt as ```

```

```
Write a reference manual for the Javascript language. For each of the following topics, provide a description and (where applicable) a simple example:

values, data types

operations / operators / operands

variables, var

reserved words
  JavaScript has a number of reserved words that you cannot use as identifiers. Reserved words have a specific meaning to the JavaScript language, as they are part of the language syntax. Using a reserved word causes a compilation error when loading your script.

  Examples:

  | break | default | function  | return  | var |
  -----------------------------------------
  | case  | delete  | if  | switch  | void |
  -----------------------------------------
  | catch  | do  | in  | this  | while |
  -----------------------------------------
  | const | else  | instanceof  | throw | with |
  -----------------------------------------
  | continue | finally | let | try |
  -----------------------------------------
  | debugger | for | newtypeof |
  -----------------------------------------

statements vs. expressions -
   a statement is any valid piece of code that ends in a either a semi colon termination or is enclosed within {}.
      examples var a = true;
               console.log("Write this out to console please");
               if (x==y) {
                 do this stuff
               }

   An expression is anything that evaluates to a value.  
    examples - "(1 > 0), "a == false", "indexOf(x,"y")"

variables vs. values

if-else

while

for

for-in

functions

local vs. global variables

arrays

objects

methods
    **the different uses of . [] {} ;**
      . accessing/calling methods
      . accessing/assigning properties of objects

      [] creating arrays i.e.  var my ar= [1,2,3]
      [] access/assign to indexes of arrays ar[0]
      [] access/assign to key of object o["I'm a key"] =4

      {} bodies of functions,loops, if/else...
      {} compound statements
      {} create objects {foo:3, 'hi there':9}

      ; end of statement without {}
      ; separators between condition pre-post condition in for loops

      () surrounds condition
      () calling a function and methods (surrounds arguments)
      () control order of operations (2+3)/2
      () around function parameters in function statements

object links
anonymous functions
nested function scope / closures
exceptions
try-catch
  The try statement allows you to define a block of code to be tested for errors while it is being executed.

  The catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

  The finally statement lets you execute code, after try and catch, regardless of the result.
  Example:
  try {
    int result = divide(2,1);
    System.out.println(result);
    } catch (BadNumberException e) {
      //do something clever with the exception
      System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    }
    
the global namespace
important functions and objects in the global namespace
DOM methods and properties
event handlers
